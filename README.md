# Welcome To L337

I am working slowly on making a Cyber Security game that will be extremely accurate to the actual tasks done by Cyber professionals in our field. 
The hope is to not gamify the actual tools and tactics used in the real world but to gamify the process of learning them. 
The basic concept would be that the user starts the game out with only a command line, and slowly builds up points by completing hacking for hire contracts. 
With the points, the player would then be able to unlock new complex tools to use such as Ghidra or Hashcat. 
If you feel interested in collaborating on the code for this game, sound design, or just contributing to the project in any way to make it the best thing it can be.. 
Feel free to hit me up!
